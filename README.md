This is my personal portfolio website for showcasing my projects, skills, and experience as a software engineer.  
It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed using Vercel.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Structure & Layout**
   - The site is built as a single-page portfolio using semantic HTML sections for Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
   - A fixed navigation bar at the top lets users jump to each section.

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Uses CSS media queries to adjust layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
   - Elements like the navbar, project cards, and text stack or resize depending on screen width.

3. **Projects Section**
   - Each project is shown as a card with a title, short description, and links (e.g., GitHub / live demo).
   - Project cards are stored in HTML and styled via CSS to form a grid.

4. **Interactive Navigation**
   - JavaScript handles smooth scrolling when the user clicks on navigation links.
   - Active section highlighting helps users see where they are on the page.

5. **Contact Section**
   - Includes a contact form and/or contact details (email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
   - Makes it easy for recruiters or collaborators to reach out directly.

6. **Deployment**
   - The site is deployed on Vercel.
   - Whenever I push changes to the main branch on GitHub, Vercel rebuilds and redeploys the live site automatically.
